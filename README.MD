# Speedometer for Windows 10 Mobile

I made this app in an effort to bring my Lumia to life, using it as a Speedometer for my Motorcycle <3
I was sad when I realized that device has a bunch of sensors, internet connection and a SOC ready to use and no apps are available

This Stack use Windows build 10.0.14393 (you can try to using another version)

Works perfect in Lumia (tested 435)

## Recomendations to dev, build, deploy

Use Visual Studio 2017 Community (I installed from chocolatey [https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/VisualStudio2017Community] `choco install visualstudio2017community`)

On Visual Studio 2017 installer, select the Windows SDK (this project use 10.0.14393 and I think it works on 10.0.17134)

## I want .appx!!

Im working on builds ready to install, this is a testing project
